        <h1>Network Spinal Chiropractic</h1>
        <h4>What is it?</h4>
        <p>
          Network Spinal (NS) is a chiropractic technique that has been developed, refined and taught
          by its founder Dr Donald Epstein since the early 1980’s. NS care is characterised by the
          development of two “waves”. Firstly, the respiratory wave – as the tension in the spine and
          surrounding musculature reduces, the vertebrae are able to move and rock through a
          greater range of motion with each breath. Secondly the Network Wave – this generally
          begins to develop in Level 2 of care (sometimes earlier). This wave moves through the
          connective tissue at successively deeper levels with each Level of Care, encouraging a higher
          level of tissue re-organisation to occur.
        </p>
        <h4>How does it work?</h4>
        <p>
          The strategies used in NS care are very specific light contacts (finger pressure) to the regions
          where the meningeal coverings of the spinal cord attach into the spinal column (mainly
          around the neck and sacrum/pelvis). These contacts bring greater awareness to the cortex
          (brain) and increasing coherence (ie higher functioning) of the nervous system.
        </p>
        <h4>Why would I do it?</h4>
        <p>
          At Quantum Network Spinal our overall aim is to develop greater coherence and
          communication within and between the nervous system, the musculoskeletal system and
          the emotional system. This is experienced by you as a higher expression of your authentic
          self.
        </p>
        <h4>Where does pain fit into this picture?</h4>
        <p>
          There are a number of different types of pain we all experience including
          <ul>
            <li>Physical pain</li>
            <li>Pain of wanting to avoid pain</li>
            <li>Pain of not being able to manage our circumstances</li>
            <li>Pain of not making progress fast enough</li>
            <li>Pain of not knowing, or not giving, our gifts because we made our life too small</li>
          </ul>
          Pain is often the motivator for someone to seek out healthcare. Pain has a purpose. It is
          meant to interrupt your life. Something is breaking down physically and/or emotionally. It is
          a signal that there is not enough energy available within the system to self-organise that
          area. Pain is an invitation to change (behaviour, perception and/or structure). NS care is all
          about what you are moving toward, what you want more of. If you no longer had this pain
          what would you be able to do/think/achieve? Who would you be? What is life calling you
          to? What would life be like if you could live a higher version of your authentic self
          effortlessly?

        <h1>Somato Respiratory Integration (SRI)</h1>
        <center><small>The following excerpts are adapted from “Somato Respiratory Integration Workbook” Donald M. Epstein 2009</small></center>
        <h4>What is it?</h4>
        <p>
          Somato Respiratory Integration (SRI) educates you to your body’s own rhythms and inner
          wisdom through focused attention, gentle breath, movement and touch. SRI is designed to
          offer you new options in your experience of your body and your personal healing. At
          Quantum Network Spinal you will learn the specific exercises of SRI which link enhanced
          somatic (body) awareness with respiration.
        </p>
        <h4>How does it work?</h4>
        <p>
          An underlying principle of this practice is to fully accept where you are at and to experience
          it fully. Even when the experience is uncomfortable or painful it is to be experienced as the
          energy it really is. At Quantum Network Spinal we will integrate the exercises of the 12
          Stages of SRI with the Levels of Care of Network Spinal to advance the progress of each
          individual. SRI exercises can be done by you at any time.
        </p>
        <h4>Why would I do it?</h4>
        <p>
          The goal of SRI is to help you develop lifetime skills, safety, strength, wisdom, and love in
          relationship to the experience of your body, its vibration, structure and energy. Some are
          first motivated to learn this skill in relationship to a symptom, illness or crisis to experience
          greater safety within one’s own body. For many, SRI provides the connection with embodied
          emotion, intelligence and spirit. For others it is the desire to use the body as a reference
          point to their state of consciousness. Through the use of your own hands, directed
          movement, focused breath, and certain well-timed statements reflecting the inner state,
          you initiate mechanisms otherwise inhibited of unavailable.

        <h1>Network Spinal Chiropractic Levels of Care</h1>
        <p>
          Level 1 of care is the foundation. Our focus is the building of spinal and neural integrity.
          Creating internal connection and communication – cortical awareness and the self-
          regulation of tension. Development of the Respiratory Wave. Adding stability to the system.

        </p>
        <p>
          Level 2 of care shifts gear. Physically we develop multiple synchronised spinal oscillators
          signifying greater coherence within the system as a whole. This is experienced as a change
          in outlook. Where once there was no concept of options now there is a sense of “enough of
          this” and “I deserve more than this”. Now we see that in fact there are options A, B, C and D
          when previously we just did what we always did. Development of the Network Wave.
          Keyword – <strong>TRANSFORM</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Level 3 of care opens up a whole new reality. We develop the heart oscillator and its
          synchronisation with the spinal oscillators. The Network Wave moves forward of the spinal
          cord for the first time into the anterior tissues. Greater sense of community and connection
          to “the all”. Keyword - <strong>AWAKEN</strong>
