        <h2>Technique</h2>
        <p>Network Spinal (NS) and Somatic Respiratory Integration (SRI) are two techniques 
        developed by Dr Donald Epstein (Chiropractor) over the last 30 years. These are the primary 
        techniques offered at Quantum Network Spinal. Both bring increased cortical (brain) 
        awareness and greater communication between the different subsystems of the body 
        (passive, active and emotional). Overall increased coherence within the system is both 
        observed and experienced. NS utilises specific light touch mainly around the areas where 
        the meningeal coverings of the spinal cord anchor into the spinal column. 
        SRI connects breath with touch on the body and movement. 
        Both weave together to advance people through the three Levels of care.</p>
