      <h3>Dr Alison Brooker Chiropractor</h3>
        <p>
          Alison first considered studying Chiropractic in her final year of high school. Instead she ended up
          studying Podiatry. Some years later it was no longer enough. So, when she asked herself “if there
          were no ifs, ands, buts or maybes in this world…no barriers…what would I want to be doing?” the
          unequivocal answer was “be a Network Spinal Chiropractic practitioner”. The following year Alison
          began the first of 5 years of chiropractic study at RMIT University (Melbourne) to make it happen.
          And it was totally worth it. Now as the principle Chiropractor at Quantum Network Spinal, Alison
          delights to go to work each day. Seeing the changes in people spines and lives is an amazing
          privilege. A keen seminar attendee, Alison is continually refining and updating her skills. Outside of
          work Alison loves hanging out with her nieces, nephews, great nieces and great nephews (we all
          LOVE waterslides!), playing table tennis and walking her 2 Labradoodles (Max and Simba).
