        <h4>What is it?</h4>
        <p>
          Network Spinal (NS) is a chiropractic technique that has been developed,
          refined and taught by its founder Dr Donald Epstein since the early 1980’s.
        </p>
        <h4>How does it work?</h4>
        <p>
          The strategies used in NS care are light specific contacts (finger pressure) to the regions
          where the meningeal coverings of the spinal cord attach into the spinal column (mainly
          around the neck and sacrum). These contacts bring awareness to the cortex (brain) and
          increasing coherence ie higher functioning of the nervous system.
          NS care is characterised by the development of two “waves”. Firstly, the respiratory wave –
          as the tension in the spine and surrounding musculature reduces the vertebrae are able to
          move and rock through greater range of motion with each breath. Secondly the Network
          Wave - generally begins to develop in Level 2 of care (sometimes earlier). This wave moves
          through the connective tissue at successively deeper levels with the Levels of care
          momentarily destabilising the tissue and encouraging a higher level of re-organisation..
        </p>
        <h4>Why would I do it?</h4>
        <p>
          At Quantum Network Spinal our overall aim is to develop greater coherence and
          communication within and between the nervous system, musculoskeletal system and
          emotional system. This is experienced as a higher expression of your authentic self.
        </p>
        <h4>Where does pain fit into this picture?</h4>
        <p>
          Pain is often the motivator for someone to seek out healthcare. Pain has a purpose. It is
          meant to interrupt your life. It is a signal that there is not enough energy to self-organise
          that area. Something is breaking down physically or emotionally. Pain is an invitation to
          change (behaviour, perception or structure). NS care is all about what you are moving
          toward, what you want more of. If you no longer had this pain what would you be able to
          do/think/achieve? Who would you be? What is life calling you to?
